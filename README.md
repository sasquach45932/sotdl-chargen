# Module is BETA!
Inspired by [Roll New Character Stats (RNCS)](https://github.com/MrXofar/roll-new-character-stats) module.

This module requires the [Shadow of the Demon Lord Compendia](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sdlc-1000). It's a paid module you need to purchase it.

It supports ancestries from this Compendia only, using its rolltables and items.

The module supports:

- `Minus 1 / Plus 1` attribute adjustment
