# Shadow Of The Demon Lord - Zero Level Chargen for FoundryVTT

# Module is BETA! Only manual installation is possible.
Inspired by [Roll New Character Stats (RNCS)](https://github.com/MrXofar/roll-new-character-stats) module.

This module requires the [Shadow of the Demon Lord Compendia](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sdlc-1000). It's a paid module you need to purchase it.

Module fetches all the ancestries from the `sdlc-*` compendia. Those ancestries which name contains â€  sign are not fully supported, rolltable results will be rolled and/or applied on actor.

Fully supported ancestries from:
- Core Compendia
- Demom Lord's Companion 1

The module supports:
- Attribute re-rolling, using Formula: `BaseValue-2 + 1d3`
- `Minus 1 / Plus 1` attribute adjustment.
